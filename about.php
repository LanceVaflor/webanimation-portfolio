                <h3>Hello! I am Lance Daimler Vaflor. I am a BSIT 3rd year student. This is my portfolio for animation.
                    <br>You are welcome to check out my work! I am actually a novice in this field of animation. This is my
                    first time working on SVG and Canvas. <br> I have no actual work experience as of now, but hopefully soon enough. <br> </h3>
